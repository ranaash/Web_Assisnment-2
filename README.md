# Web_Assisnment-2
Task No.1:

Create a React app for a simple wish list widget. The app should use React hooks (i.e. useState,
useEffect) to manage state and implement any necessary side effects. The app should not implement
any backend. The user should be able to:
● Add an item to the list.
● Remove an item from the list.
● Set priority for each item.
● Update priority of each item.
● Sort the items on the basis of priority.
Each item in the displayed list should have a “remove” button and a “counter” to set its priority. Other
than that, there should be a button “sort” displayed on the UI to sort the list items on the basis of priority.


Task No.2:
Design a React app that takes username as input from the user and displays GitHub userprofiles
matching the input. For this, make an HTTP request to the GitHub API given in the following
link: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28#search-users
Show name, link to the profile, and avatar for each result as displayed in the image below. The
image is just for your understanding, do not replicate the design.
